            <p id="infopar">Nowadays, great, powerful pieces of equipment are available for purchase and consumer use. But, memory with great specs like <i class="high">speed, latency, timing, clock speed, transfers, and bandwidth</i> come with a price. A high quality DDR4 RAM can cost upwards of <i class="high">120 dollars on average</i>! Great CPU’s with amazingly fast and upgraded caches will cost around <i class="high">2,500 dollars</i>. Forms of ROM are generally <i class="high">quite cheap</i>, but if you plan to <i class="high">write and erase rewritable forms of ROM</i>, the price of the programmer machine to write it will cost upwards of <i class="high">1,000 dollars</i>. To <i class="high">erase</i> it, you will need to pay about <i class="high">100 dollars</i> for the UV light machine.</p>

                <p id="infopar1">The future trends with all these types of memory is that we will see many <i class="high1">game-changing modifications</i> in the industry. These upgrades might make storage larger but be able to <i class="high1">lower the price of having more Gigabytes</i>. They could also even <i class="high1">increase transfer speed</i> even more by maybe <i class="high1">doubling, tripling, quadrupling, bandwidth</i>. More pins would make the RAM even faster. RAM across every piece of technology is noticing a higher demand, so we can expect future products to be released with <i class="high1">much larger quantities</i>.</p>
                <p id="infopar2"><i class="high1">DDR5 is said to be released in 2020</i>. RAM manufacturer, <i class="high1">SK Hynix</i>, expects DDR5 to make up <i class="high1">25% of the market in 2020, and 44% in 2021</i>. DDR5 will continue with a 288-pin design, although the RAM voltage will <i class="high1">drop to 1.1V</i>. DDR5 RAM performance is expected to <i class="high1">double the fastest standard of the previous DDR4</i> generation.</p>
                <p id="infopar3">With ROM we might even find <i class="high1">easier ways to programme(re write) and erase them</i>. These ways could be cheaper and use other forms of technology. Since more people are making their own computers, we might see more <i class="high1">user friendly chips that are easier and cheaper to program</i> and customize.</p>
                <p id="infopar4">With caches, we can expect Intel to make CPU’s with caches that have even <i class="high1">larger storage capacities and faster write and read speeds</i>. Caches will become larger because that would be a huge <i class="high1">increase in efficiency</i> of devices since the retrieval latency would become much lower.</p>
